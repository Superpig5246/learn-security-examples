- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The insecure code does not validate or sanitize the inputted id in any way, so if a user were to repeatedly send the server invalid ids, they could creash the server, resulting in a denial of service. The secure version adds a try catch around the database querry to ensure that if something goes wrong in the querry, the error is gracefully handeled instead of allowing the server to crash. 


- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Additionally, we could sanatize the user input and implement rate limiting to prevent malicious users from spamming the server with requests.
